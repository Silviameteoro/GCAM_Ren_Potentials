This folder contains examples of 'configuration files' that are needed to perform any simulation in GCAM. The GCAM configuration file defines the GCAM scenario that is run, inputs to use, what mode to run, etc.

Examples in this folder are divided by technology: wind onshore and solar PV. As noted in the manuscript, scenarios runs were made separately by technology. The examples presented here assume a simulation of one case at a time. In GCAM,  it possible to set up various runs at once through 'batch files'. Instructions to perform simulations using the batch file option are provided here: https://jgcri.github.io/gcam-doc/user-guide.html#gcam-batch-mode

General instructions to run GCAM can be found here: https://jgcri.github.io/gcam-doc/user-guide.html
